# Feature: Eisenhower Quick-Tagging

## Intent
Rapidly categorize tasks by urgency/importance and schedule or remove accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Inline grid allows tagging: **Do Now / Schedule / Delegate / Delete**.
2. “Schedule” opens date/time picker; morning bias for important-not-urgent.
3. “Delegate” requires assignee or creates a “Waiting/Delegated” entry.
4. “Delete” archives the task (recoverable).
5. Matrix view shows current distribution counts.

## Notes
- Helps avoid the “mere-urgency” trap; pairs with Weekly Review.
