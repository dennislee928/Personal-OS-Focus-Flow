# Feature: Daily Start Ritual

## Intent
Provide a 7–10 minute guided start-of-day process that reduces cognitive load and sets up a focused day.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Capture step** exists and allows quick entry to Inbox.
2. **Clarify step** supports 2-minute rule and Do/Delegate/Defer actions.
3. User can select **exactly six** tasks (Ivy-6) and reorder them.
4. Scheduler can place at least **two** focus blocks; default Pomodoro 25/5.
5. Starting the first block highlights the **frog** and activates Do Not Disturb.
6. The ritual completes ≤ 10 minutes under normal load (≤ 20 inbox items).

## Non-Functional
- Keyboard-first navigation; minimal mouse.
- Persist ritual outcomes (selected six + planned blocks) to storage.

## Notes
- Grounded in GTD (capture/clarify/organize/reflect/engage), Ivy-Lee six tasks, and Pomodoro intervals with a morning peak focus window.
